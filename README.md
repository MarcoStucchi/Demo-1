## Project-Specific snippets
It is possible to have a global snippets file (JSON with file suffix .code-snippets) scoped to your project. Project-folder snippets are created with the **New Snippets file for ''...** option in the **Preferences: Configure User Snippets** dropdown menu and are located at the root of the project in a .vscode folder. Project snippet files are useful for sharing snippets with all users working in that project. Project-folder snippets are similar to global snippets and can be scoped to specific languages through the scope property
